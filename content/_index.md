# Polygeist Overview

Polygeist is a new compilation flow that connects the MLIR compiler
infrastructure to cutting edge polyhedral optimization tools. Our goal with
Polygeist is to connect decades of research in the polyhedral model to the new
MLIR compiler infrastructure. 


```c
double foo(double);

double grad_foo(double x) {
    return __enzyme_autodiff(foo, x);
}
```

By differentiating code after optimization, Enzyme is able to create substantially faster derivatives than existing tools that differentiate programs before optimization.

## Components

Polygeist is composed of three pieces:

*   A C and C++ frontend enables entering the MLIR compilation pipeline from a broad range of existing code.
*   A set of compilation passes to raise low-level C or C++ code to the Affine dialect in MLIR.
*   A set of compilation passes to have a bi-directional conversion between MLIR and OpenScop exchange format.
